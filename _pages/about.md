A data-driven personal website
======
I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). I am working in the Big Data and Social Computing Lab (BDSC) under the supervision of Prof. Philip S. Yu.

My research interests lie in data mining and recommender systems. I am mostly focused on developing deep learning models for recommender systems.
